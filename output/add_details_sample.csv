4 Color Bic Pen.,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2753894806,[TECÓÄìT$ECore] Olipro,"Provides a 4-color Bic Pen with the functionality of a Black, Red, Green & Blue pen.  Also makes the pencil double as an eraser, because the icon shows the pencil having an eraser, so clearly, it should be usable.  Made purely because someone on Reddit asked for it and I was bored.  On the plus side, it does add Green as a colour for your map annotations. You can also use it as a weapon, if you're a John Wick aficionado or something.  Spawns in all the same locations as other pens, albeit with slightly more rarity.  Workshop ID: 2753894806 Mod ID: 4ColorBicPen",2753894806,['4ColorBicPen']

Chapter is denoted by color and visible numbers. Similar books share logos and main color palette.  Modders: You may notice I made a bunch of extras. Feel free to use them in your own work!

Better Hand Wash (41.60+),Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594865484,Sunnyyyyholic,"Currently, the amount of water for washing socks required 10 water. This is the same amount of water to wash a jacket. Besides, if very little blood splashes on your clothes, you need 10 water to wash it. I feels weird when I do wash clothes. and this is very annoying if you have hemophobic. so the amount of water required for washing should be the sum of the amount of blood and dirt on the clothes.  - Before : any clothes require 10 amount of waters for washing. - After : different conditions of clothes use different amounts of water for washing.  this mod will require 1 water to wash socks, but a jacket with a very large amount of blood may require more than 10 water.  for 41.56 link : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2683571094  Workshop ID: 2594865484 Mod ID: Betterhandwash",2594865484,['Betterhandwash']

Better lockpicking,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2368058459,Aiteron,"ATTENTION For multiplayer for work this mod need add also second mod ""Profession framework b41"" !!!    Description - Adds the mechanics of breaking the locks of doors, windows and cars using a bobbypin or crowbar. Lockpicking is done with mini-games! - Adds a mini-game of lockpicking ignition using wires. Also, the ignition lock can be broken with a bobbypin and a screwdriver. - Adds the ability to check the alarms of home and cars - Adds the ""Lockpicking"" skill. - Adds the Lockpicking perk and expands the Burglar profession Instruction Alarm  To check the alarm, read the ""Alarm for Dummies"" magazine. Next, to check the house alarm, right-click on the window/door and select the menu item. To check the car alarm, select an item in the radial menu while standing at the car hood. Lockpicking   - In order to start lockpicking you need to read the ""Lockpicking for Dummies"" magazine. To lockpick doors/windows, right-click on them and select lockpick. To break with a bobbypin, you need a bobbypin and a screwdriver. For breaking with a crowbar - a crowbar. - Also, your skill level should match the difficulty level of the lock. I recommend pumping the skill on easy locks (starting with very easy ones). - To hack a car, go to the door that you want to open and select an item in the radial menu. (the item will appear only if the door is locked) - When breaking with a bobbypin, you can try to unlock the lock by force if you are in a hurry. But the chance of success is small. - Mini-game lockpicking with a bobbypin - Similar to the logic of lockpicking from Fallout/Skyrim. You need to choose the desired angle of the bobbypin and turn the lock - Mini-game breaking with a crowbar - You need to press the Space bar in time to open the door faster. Ignition switch  - Mini-game finding 2 ignition wires - you need to find 2 wires from the lower wires and connect them. - Now you can lockpick the ignition lock with a bobbypin (if your skill level matches the difficulty of the lock) Items - Lockpicking magazine - Alarm magazine - Bobbypin - Homemade bobbypin (made from paper clips (You need a screwdriver for this!))   Play with pleasure :D     UPDATE - Now you can lock doors by lockpicking - Better balance in difficult level of locks of cars/doors/windows - Better UI hotwire - Added translates  Big update! - Changed the balance of the lockpicking. Now you can try to pick any lock. The higher the level, the easier it is to lockpick and the less chance of breaking the lock/window. - Now you can not break the ignition locks with a lockpick (Balance) - The progress of lockpicking with a crowbar is saving now - Fixed a bug that it is impossible to lockpick the door inside buildings - Improved alarm check process - Increased strength of the lockpick - Added new translations  Update - Fixed bug with speed in crowbar minigame  Update: - Added Spanish  Update: - Updated for 41.53 (Thanks for help Erivan!)

Car Dashboard Radio Button,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2736059670,Kaldo,"Adds the radio button to vehicle dashboards. Clicking on it opens the device panel, same as the one from the radial menu. The icon is green if radio is currently on, red if the key is in ignition and the radio is missing from the car, and gray otherwise.  Added support for True Music. If you also have that mod installed clicking the radio icon with the right mouse button opens the cassette player instead.  If you run into any issues after the last update try resubscribing to the mod, that seems to solve it. I've tested it with both true music on and off, with load order both before and after the mod, and it worked fine in every case so it seems to be something weird going on with workshop and not the mod itself.  Known issues: In MP if another person is in a vehicle with you it seems it breaks the button and makes it do nothing. Not sure when will I get a chance to look into this, the MP side of modding is still alien to me.

The latest blog post by The Indie Stone (https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2023/11/one-door-openz/) seems to hint that they will add a fuel-side indicator to the vanilla game on Build 42. I'm so happy that the developers noticed this small UI/UX tweak enough to warrant it to be in the base game. It has always been my intention to make this mod in the hopes of getting it implemented in vanilla. Cheers to all who have supported this mod and I'm sure it will still come handy until B42 comes out.  Also, This mod still works even though it's been over a year since I updated it. Works for Build 41.78+    Build 41.68 Patch - Fixed error with Agrotsar Tractor* - Fixed compatibility with two-wheeled vehicles**  **For some bikes, the mod makers made it so that you could refuel on both sides, in this case I have disabled the indicator. *You may also find that the indicator does not appear in certain vehicles, this is because the mod makers have done some weird stuff on their vehicles that hinders this mod to get info on the gas tank location. One example of this is the Agrotsar Tractor that does not have a gas tank area which this mod relies on.  This mod should be loaded LAST. Specifically, after enabling other vehicle mods. For server owners, place FSI at the end of the list of mods or after other vehicle mods.    Description  Find it annoying to turn your vehicle around in a gas station and attracting MORE zombies? Do you wish there was a way to know which side your car's gas tank is at?  Fuel Side Indicator is a simple addition to your vehicle's dashboard that lets you know which side you have to park your car when refuelling!    Author's Notes  This is my first UI mod! Please be patient with any bugs you may encounter and report them in the comments below.  - No need for a new save, just enable it and you're ready - To disable, just disable the mod itself  Big thanks to the PZ discord modding community! Special shout out to Shurutsue as well!  COMPATIBILITY: Build 41.78+ *Compatible with ALL vehicle mods! (as long as the vehicle has wheels) *If you have a mod that tweaks the vehicle dashboard, this mod may conflict with it but not likely if it's a minor tweak.  MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBILITY: * This should work since this is a client-side mod. Let me know down in the comments if you have trouble with the mod on your server.    REPACKING is ALLOWED.

More Description for Traits [41.78],Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2685168362,Champy,"Update November 2nd, 2023:  - Updated the Ukrainian translation (thanks to @Dream Doc) - Updated the Korean translation (thanks to @earlyou) - Added the Italian translation (thanks to @Lore11)    This mod is intended for players who are confused about what effects each trait and profession has on the character.  It adds description to the traits that need it to describe their effects on the character in detail, instead of leaving people guessing with vague sentences. This way, players can have an easier time imagining their own builds by themselves.  It also adds the description on mouse hover in the character's info screen, in game. This works with descriptions of traits from other mods too, like Banjo's item kits or Dynamic traits for example.  This is based on a combination of my own knowledge, the game's non-exposed Java files (that I learned how to decompile), the game's exposed Lua files, your feedback, and the wiki of PZ.  Most of what I added in the traits' descriptions are in parenthesis so you can distinguish what is vanilla description and what is not.  If you notice a typo, or know of an effect that is not listed, or spot something that is wrong or poorly worded, please leave a comment to point it out to me. I don't think I got every single effect that could be listed, and I may have made a mistake somewhere, so I'm relying on you guys for that.    Compatibility Works with build 41 and in multiplayer. Compatible with: Dynamic Traits, More Traits, Banjo's Item kits, More Simple Traits...also Driving Skill, Scavenger Skill... So it should be compatible with any mod that adds traits or skills.    Note: I will not list any EXPLOIT or BUG that is clearly unintended as part of a trait or profession's effects. The issue with Weak Stomach has been noted, and I made a bug report to the devs. If they don't fix it, I will update the description to point out the unintended issue. For those who want to know, the issue with Weak Stomach is    Translations French: Done German: Done Spanish: Done, but needs confirmation Russian: incomplete (needs an update) Turkish: incomplete (needs an update) Portuguese-Brazil: Done Simplified Chinese: incomplete (needs an update) Traditional Chinese: Done Korean: Done Polish: Done Italian: Done Ukrainian: Done Other languages : non-existant  Anyone is welcome to volunteer to translate to their language.   Foraging stats: The mod details the foraging stats bonuses for each trait and profession. Stats are : Foraging radius bonus, Weather Effect reduction, and Darkness Effect reduction and also Specialisation bonuses for every foraging category. All foraging stats are added dynamically, which means any balance changes will be automatically updated, and other traits that get foraging stats in their descriptions (if they have foraging stats). Source file: media/lua/shared/Foraging/forageDefinitions.lua   Character Info Screen Tooltip: The mod displays the detailed description of each trait in the character's info screen window on mouse hover. Works for professions too (except Unemployed since it doesn't have an image). Works with traits of other mods too! Although their descriptions probably won't be as detailed.

Rain Wash,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2657661246,NoctisFalco,"Rain washes blood and dirt away. Including the character's body, clothing, equipped bags, equipped and attached weapons, the vehicle your character is in and vehicle attached to it or last used vehicle and vehicle attached to it.  How it works Body, clothing, bags, weapons When it's raining and your character is outside (and not in a car, of course) the mentioned things will slowly be cleaned. The process begins as soon as a body part* or item becomes wet: some of its blood is turned into dirt, then the dirt is washed away.  Not everything is cleaned at the same time! Notice how wetness is increased: top layer of clothing / uncovered body parts -> inner layer of clothing -> covered body parts. It's a vanilla mechanic.  How fast an item or body will be cleaned depends on rain intensity and the item's or body's wetness. Not all dirt will be washed off clothes! Depending on the water resistance of the clothing, up to 20% of dirt will remain. Not all dirt will be washed off your character! Up to 10% of dirt will remain.  Vehicles The vehicle your character is in and the vehicle attached to it will be cleaned.  The last used vehicle and the vehicle attached to it will be cleaned after your character leaves it too. This works as long as your character is within approximately 100 squares of these vehicles. After reloading the save you need to enter/exit again for this to work.  Wash In The Rain When your character is outside and it's raining right click and you'll see the ""Wash In The Rain"" option. Works like ""Wash Yourself"" but slower and your character will take off all clothes (and put them on after finishing).  Options If you want to configure the mod, you need to install and enable the Mod Options mod. Go to Options -> Mods -> Rain Wash.  Compatibility Game version: Build 41.56+ (MP supported) This mod is compatible with: - any mods that add clothing, bags and weapons; - any mods that add/change character traits; - any mods that add vehicles.

Read While Walking,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845952197,star,"You can read while walking.  Bonus Features - Also you can start/stop reading a book by pressing ""R"". So you can read/fight almost simultaneously using just keyboard. - You can start reading even if the book is in a container nearby, you will take it. - The key ""R"" is configurable if you have ModOptions. But it'ok, no conflict with building mode and reloading. - Pressing the key ""R"" just doesn't work for reading if you have a gun in you hand or you are in the building mode:   Key ""R"" priority - Favorite books have more priority. But unfinished book has the most priority. - Inventory books have more priority over books in backpacks, and backpacks have more priority over containers.  Reading Fog and restrictions - Now reading will enable dark ""foraging fog"" (see the screenshot). - You can tune the darkness while reading in sandbox options. - You can't read in search mode. - Also your fatigue affects your view radius while reading.   Compatibility It's compatible with future updates of the game (e.g. with build 42+) and any good mods. You may safely enable/disable it. Works in multiplayer. Compatible with the rude mods.

Share Annotations,Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815560151,belette,"Compatible with version 41.78.16 (solo & multiplayer).  This mod allows you to share your map annotations with your friends using any piece of paper in a lore-friendly way.  Features: write down annotations using pen and paper to share with others trade and store annotations as a regular item memorize Annotated Maps to your own map pick which sets of annotations you'd like to see on your map easily forget learned annotations if needed opt-in to loot fully annotated maps off player corpses  Officially compatible with: Draw On Map (see caveat below) Map Symbol Size Slider  Muchas gracias to HawK for the Spanish translation! Ë¨ùË¨ù UnsetLay for the Traditional Chinese translation! Merci Furthick for the French translation! –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ FREEMAN96REG for the Russian translation! Te≈üekk√ºrler Neo Wolffe for the Turkish translation! D√≠ky NarcisSally for the Czech translation! Obridago Hicaro for the Brazilian Portuguese translation!  Enjoy!  Compatibility with Draw On Map  Draw On Map works by adding a LOT of ""dot"" annotations to your map to simulate drawing lines. This can lead to thousands of symbols created.  Project Zomboid has a 2,097,152 bytes limit for player objects when saving them to the database. Player objects include inventory, which may include a Shared Map created with this mod. Now, if you created a map containing thousands of symbols, you may hit the 2MB limit, meaning that your player cannot be saved anymore. If that happens, you will see a red box error in the bottom right corner.  This simply means that you cannot keep that map item in your inventory, because it contains too much data (the thousands of ""dots"" created by Draw On Map). After using the map (e.g. remembering annotations), you can drop it on the ground, store it or delete it, and your character should be fine again.

Snow is water [MP Working - v1.3.1],Addon,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2704811006,Buhorl,"Info Snow is still water, so Rain Collectors and Metal Barrels will be filled when snowing, just at a slower rate (50%). It's a small mod that I created for myself for winter storm playthroughs. It works great paired with mods such as Cryogenic winter, Eternal Snow or Infinite Weather. Mod won't be updated for a while since people don't like that as much and I don't have much time. The standard version works in SP and MP the latest builds!  WARNING Do not use the beta version (snowiswaterbeta), it's been broken for versions past 41.74 and I don't have time to fix it. If you want to use the mod, use the Standard version/mod file (snowiswater)  Features Included in the Standard Version ( snowiswater ): Rain Barrels (both variants) are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%). Metal Barrels are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%).  In the Beta Version ( snowiswaterbeta ): Once again, do not use past version v41.75 Items such as Pots and Buckets will also fill up when snowing with tainted water. This should work without a problem in MP, but it's labeled as a beta version since there could be some issues with it. Added configurable settings with "" ModOptions"" to change the ratio in which all the items fill up. The default is 50% but can be changed to 25%, 75% and even 100%. Planned features (WIP): Improved option to add ""realism"" to the snow/water limit and filling rate on barrels. Texture changes deppending on the weather.  Beta Incompatibilities As of patch 41.74, I have been informed that certain mods that add new items seem to break when the full version is working. I am currently working on a fix to adress these issues but it may take a while. For now, either switch to the ""lite"" version of my mod or try to avoid mods that add ""fillable"" containers, as they will be the ones causing the errors (i.e: Snake's mod pack). As of newer versions, the Beta version of the mod breaks certain actions due to the way the mod overides functions. I recommend to stop using the beta version and use the standard for now.  If you liked the mod, please let me know I really appreciate all the comments and positive feedback I've received. Thanks a lot to all of you who decided to spend some time to write them down :)    Want to help me even more? Give me a ko-fi!

This will conflict with any other mods that also replace BodyLocations.lua   Supports B41.71+. Should work in multiplayer. Adds new ways that many clothing items can be worn - including: opening jackets, rolling up & opening shirts, tying sweaters, and tucking in pants. This affects every vanilla jacket, sweater, coveralls, pants, and most shirts.  Opening a jacket/shirt will reduce its insulation, water and wind resistance by 25%. Rolling up the sleeves on a shirt will expose your forearms. Tying a sweater around your waist will only protect your lower body. Tucking in pants is only cosmetic.   Requires the Extra Clothing Tweaker API as well as the Extra Clothing Options addon.   It's fine to use and edit my assets for your own mods as long as you can credit me.
